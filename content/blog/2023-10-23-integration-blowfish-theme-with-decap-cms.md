This is the story of how I integrated Blowfish theme in Hugo with DecapCMS. 

I love how Hugo builds in seconds and serves static HTML without extra JavaScript or network calls to a database. It offers improved SEO and a better user experience. What I don't like is that to make changes, I need to open up VIM on the computer with my Git repo. I want to be able log into an admin site and make edits and posts from a web browser a la WordPress style. But what I don't want is to manage a MySQL instance and keep all my site data in MySQL - or a database for that matter.
