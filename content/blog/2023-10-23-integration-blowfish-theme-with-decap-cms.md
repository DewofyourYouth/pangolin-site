This is the story of how I integrated Blowfish theme in Hugo with DecapCMS. 

I love how Hugo builds in nano seconds and serves static HTML without extra JavaScript or network calls to a database. It offers improved SEO and a better user experience. What I don't like is that to make changes, I would often need to open up VIM on the computer with my Git repo. I want to be able log into an admin site and make edits and posts from a web browser a la WordPress style. But what I *don't* want is to manage a MySQL instance and keep all my site data in MySQL - or any database for that matter (other than git, technically a database ðŸ˜…). This is where DecapCMS comes in.

DecapCMS, formerly NetlifyCMS, is a git based CMS. It offers a web interface to commit markdown files to my git repo - and generate my site, using Git as the single source of truth. DecapCMS [has instructions for integrating with Hugo](https://decapcms.org/docs/hugo/), but with Hugo there's also a need to integrate with whatever hugo theme your using. I'm using Blowfish theme:

### Setting Up Thumbnails

Many Hugo theme expect you to make a directory for each blog post, and then put the markdown in an `index.md` folder and put whatever featured image you're using for the blog post in that directory. Here is a link to[ how Blowfish says to make a thumbnail](https://blowfish.page/docs/thumbnails/). Basically, they say to make the blog post into a directory and name an image "featured.jpg" or whatever image extension. Like this:

```
content
â””â”€â”€ awesome_article
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.md
    â””â”€â”€ featured.png
```

But DecapCMS makes posts by committing a file. And I want to upload featured images via DecapCMS. I also prefer images that I can reuse based on my needs, I don't want them to be based on a specific location.

So step one is overriding Blowfish's way to find a featured image. To override a theme in Hugo, you find the related HTML template in the theme - and you copy it to your `layouts/_default` folder. For example, I discovered that the partial html folder in Blowfish responsible for the featured image in the blog post's hero section is `themes/blowfish/layouts_default/partials/hero/basic.html` so I make a `layouts_default/partials/hero/basic.html` file in my root directory. I copy whatever is in the theme's html - so I can make changes.

This is the contents of the original `basic.html` file:

```go
{{ $disableImageOptimization := .Page.Site.Params.disableImageOptimization | default false }}

{{- $images := .Resources.ByType "image" -}}
{{- $featured := $images.GetMatch "*feature*" -}}
{{- if not $featured }}
  {{ $featured = $images.GetMatch "{*cover*,*thumbnail*}" }}
{{ end -}}
{{- with $featured -}}
    {{ if $disableImageOptimization }}
        {{ with . }}
            <div 
              class="w-full h-36 md:h-56 lg:h-72 single_hero_basic nozoom" 
              style="background-image:url({{ .RelPermalink }});"></div>
        {{ end }}
    {{ else }}
        {{ with .Resize "1200x" }}
            <div 
              class="w-full h-36 md:h-56 lg:h-72 single_hero_basic nozoom" 
              style="background-image:url({{ .RelPermalink }});"></div>
        {{ end }}
    {{ end }}
{{- end -}}
```

The template does the following:

1. Checks for the images in the local directory relative to **current page.** See the [Hugo docs here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-resources/) to see how.
2. If there's an image file with the `*feature*` in the name it uses that as the image.
3. If not it looks for images with cover or thumbnail in the name.
4. It uses that image with image optimization, unless image optimization has been disabled.
