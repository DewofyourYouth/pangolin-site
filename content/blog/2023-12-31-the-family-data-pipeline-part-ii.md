In my last blog post, I decided to start making a data base to store data (my Aunt Ruth's notes) about my family tree in a graph database. It was all great fun, but since then I've learnt a thing or two about data modeling in Neo4j, or graph databases in general. Also, on going through Aunt Ruth's notes, I see much of the notes are limited due to limitations of whatever software she was using. For example, many notes just say to look at the notes related to someone else. It seems one of the limitations of the software was an inability to share notes among people nodes.
